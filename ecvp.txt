We know that the appearance of a color depnds on the colors nearby.
Even though the circle color is the same in the square
with the circle drawn in the center, the brightness of the circle seems
to be different depending on the brightness of the background color.
The brighter the background color looks darker than the dark one.ã€€
In this research,
we prepared many printed samples with a slightly different brightness of the center circle and show them to subjects to select the same sample as the center brightness of the reference image.
to the persons who choose the ones 
that look the same brightness of the circles.

The color of the samples are evaluated in the L*a*b* color space by a colorimeter.
As a result, in the case that the lightness of the background color are 80 and 40,
there is about 5 difference is obtained.
