 \headerbox{An Effect of Contrast}{name=contrast,column=0,row=0,span=2}{%
The appearance of a color depends on the colors near it. In two squares
 with center circles of the same color , the brightness of the circles
 will appear to differ depending on the brightness of their
 backgrounds. 

 \ShowFigS{{fig-0-50}{fig-80-50}}{0.15}{An effect of contrast}{contrast}
 The brighter the background, the darker its circle
 appears.

 In this research, we want to quantify perception of the difference in the
 brightness of the circles.}
 \headerbox{The experimental way}
 {name=sample,column=0,below=contrast,span=2}
 {
 We prepared many printed samples with center
 circles of varying brightness. The size of the sample is 8 cm and the
 diameter of the circle is 5 cm. The background colors are black and
 light gray(80\% brightness) and the brightness of the center circles are
 from 40\% to 60\% in every 2\% by HSL color value\cite{HSL}.
 These samples are printed by Epson PX5002 inkjet printer on the paper
 Epson Crispia.

\ShowFigS{{fig-80-52}{fig-80-54}{fig-80-56}}{0.1}{Example of
 Samples(gray of brightness 52\%, 54\% and 56\%)}{fig2}
The brightness of the backgrounds in Figures\ref{fig1} and \ref{fig2}
 are $0\%$ and $90\%$, respectively. 
 
 We showed these samples to subjects and
 asked them to select a sample whose center circle has the same center
 brightness as the reference image. }
  \headerbox{Evaluation  of Colors}
 {name=sample,column=0,below=sample,span=2}
 {Since the printed color depends on the equipment,
 we have evaluated colors of the samples by a colorimeter
 TCD100\cite{TCD100}. The color differences are calculated by Excel
 datasheet given by \cite{CIEDE2000}.

 In these cases, we choose 90 as saturation, because we percieve the
 color of the circle with dark background vivider.

 $95\%$ and $100\%$.

{In all cases, the  colors of the circles in dark background are
 brighter than those in bright background. Their differences of the
 luminence are about 5. When the samples' brightness of the background
 color were 
 60, approximately 4 differences were obtained.}
