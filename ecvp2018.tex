 \headerbox{An Effect of Contrast}{name=contrast,column=0,row=0,span=2}{%
The appearance of a color depends on the colors near it. In two squares
 with center circles of the same color , the brightness of the circles
 will appear to differ depending on the brightness of their
 backgrounds. 

 \ShowFigS{{fig-0-50}{fig-90-50}}{0.1}{An effect of contrast}{contrast}
 The brighter the background, the darker its circle
 appears.

 In this research, we want to quantify perception of the difference in the
 brightness of the circles.}
 \headerbox{The experimental way}
 {name=sample,column=0,below=contrast,span=2}
 {
 We prepared many printed samples with center
 circles of varying brightness. The size of the sample is 8 cm and the
 diameter of the circle is 5 cm. The background colors are black and
 lightgray(90\% brightness) and the brightness of the center circles are
 from 40\% to 60\% in every 2\% by HSL color value\cite{HSL}.
 These samples are printed by Epson PX5002 inkjet printer on the paper
 Epson Crispia.

\ShowFigS{{fig-90-52}{fig-90-54}{fig-90-56}}{0.1}{Example of
 Samples(gray of brightness 52\%, 54\% and 56\%)}{fig2}
The brightness of the backgrounds in Figures\ref{fig1} and \ref{fig2}
 are $0\%$ and $90\%$, respectively. 
 
 We showed these samples to subjects and
 asked them to select a sample whose center circle has the same center
 brightness as the reference image. }
  \headerbox{Measurement of Colors}
 {name=sample,column=0,below=sample,span=2}
 {Since the printed color depends on the equipmnts,
 we have measured the colors of athe samples by a colorimeter
 TCD100\cite{TCD100}. The colore differences are culculaed by Excel
 datasheet given by \cite{CIEDE2000}.

{The colors of the samples were
 evaluated in the L*a*b* color space by a colorimeter. The background
 color and circle brightness in the reference image are 80 and 60,
 respectively. When the samples' brightness of the background color were
 40, approximately 6.6 differences were obtained. }
